"Sparks is a fresh and playful love story, told with wry, laugh out loud humor … Anderson uses a mischievous twist of magic to take her characters, and readers, on a cozy but exhilarating ride."

-Therese Oneill, NYT Bestselling author of Ungovernable


“Horses, monsters, and a spark of romance – this is my new favorite kind of fantasy.” —Kate Ristau, Author of Clockbreakers and Shadow Girl


“...a story comprised of romance, folklore, and the paranormal which made me feel safe and scared… [Anderson] did a fabulous job of portraying life in the barn, the riding scenes, and the horse characters. Fun, intriguing story!”

-Brittney Joy, author of the Red Rock Ranch series



"Romance, monsters, and magic … for grownups? Yes, please!"

-Karen Eisenbrey, author of Daughter of Magic and Wizard Girl



“An upbeat, witty paranormal – Anderson’s Sparks is deliciously addictive with touches of sizzling chemistry, zany twists, and quirky turns that simply leave you wanting more. Fast-paced and entertaining, Rosie and Patrick’s simmering romance, mixed with a little magical mayhem, heat up this romantic fantasy, creating a wonderfully amusing read. Clear your day because you won’t want to put this book down!”

-Heather S. Ransom, author of the Going Green trilogy
