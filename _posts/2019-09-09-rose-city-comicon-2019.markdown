I'm going to be at [Rose City Comicon](https://rosecitycomiccon.com/) on Friday, September 13, 2019, signing books ([Sparks](https://amzn.to/2JlV9pM) and my other titles) from 11:30 AM-5:30 PM.

I'll be sitting at the [Not A Pipe Publishing](http://www.notapipepublishing.com/new-events) booth with Debby Dodds, author of Amish Guys Don't Call, and a story in Strongly Worded Women, the Not a Pipe anthology my story "Getting Pregnant on the Back of a Motorcycle" is in. We'll be selling all of the Not a Pipe titles, which include some wonderful books ranging from epic fantasy to superhero comedy.

We'll be having a great time, so please drop by and join in the fun!

And hey, if you're at the [Red Pencil Editor's conference](https://edsguild.org/red-pencil-conference-2019-voice-voices/) in Seattle on September 21, look for me there, too. I'll be either sitting at the [Willamette Writer's](https://willamettewriters.org/) table, or going to sessions.

Here are even more things I'm doing this Fall (This list isn't even complete):
