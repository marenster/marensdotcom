Hi!

Thanks to my excellent spouse, I have a brand-spanking new website. I am super excited to get back to updating you all regularly with all the things I'm up to, and there are lots of things.

Briefly,

1. I have a book coming out in July 2019
2. I have a play being produced, also in July 2019
3. I am now the Editor-in-Chief of [_the Timberline Review_](http://timberlinereview.com/), the literary magazine of Willamette Writers
4. I am now the Managing Editor of [_PURE Insights_](http://www.wou.edu/pure/insights-academic-journal/), the undergraduate research journal at WOU

And that's just since February!

I'll post more details about all this soon, but for now, enjoy the fancy new headshot of me by [Gail Pasternack](https://gailpasternack.com/).
