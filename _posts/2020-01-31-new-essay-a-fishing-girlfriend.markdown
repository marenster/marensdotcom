Hi!

My short essay ["A Fishing Girlfriend"](FishingGirlfiend.pdf) was published in *Flyfisighing & Tying* Magazine in Winter 2020. I have permission from one of the editors to post this PDF of the article. 

Belated thanks to Fishboy, who may encounter this article as I am sure he is still floating on a lake somewhere, fishing.

What do you think of the essay? Any of you "left on the shore" so to speak?
