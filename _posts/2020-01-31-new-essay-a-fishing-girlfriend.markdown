Free PDF!

My short essay ["A Fishing Girlfriend"](FishingGirlfiend.pdf) was published in *Flyfisighing & Tying* Magazine in Winter 2020. I have permission from one of the editors to post this PDF of the article.

Belated thanks to Fishboy, who may or may not encounter this article as I am sure he is still floating on a lake somewhere, fishing. He did used to have these kinds of magazines lying around. 

What do you think of the essay? Any of you "left on the shore" by someone, so to speak?
