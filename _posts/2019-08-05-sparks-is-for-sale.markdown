This has been an epic summer, and it is only the first week of August. This last week as been super-epic. Here's what went down:

1. *Sparks* went on sale July 29. **[Order Now!](https://amzn.to/2JlV9pM)**

2. I am the Editor in Chief of the Timberline Review, and the new issue is now on sale! **[Buy it here!](https://amzn.to/2GPeuiv)**

3. I went to the Willamette Writers conference in Portland where I hosted the inaugural reading for the Timberline Review one night, and held an epic book launch part for *Sparks* the next night.

I am going to rest a little now, and then it's back to writing and promoting.
