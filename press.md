**Sparks** (Summer 2019)

All Rosie wants is to tear down the ancient cowshed on her ranch to make room for more horses, but it is unlucky to knock down a barn because it could disturb a sprite. Rosie thinks this is superstitious hogwash. That’s why she and her handsome new client, Patrick, get drunk one night and knock the shed down with the tractor, unleashing something very dark and very angry.

Rosie is thrust into a world of magic she didn’t know existed. But the cowsprite is deadly and won’t leave. Now all Rosie wants is for life to go back to normal. Or does she?

"Sparks is a fresh and playful love story, told with wry, laugh out loud humor and populated with characters Anderson has a knack for making feel like your dearest friends. That would be enough reason to read this. But did I mention "amoral Barn-Sprites"? Because Sparks has those, too, and they are some terrible fun. Anderson uses a mischievous  twist of magic to take her characters, and readers, on a cozy but exhilarating ride." -Therese Oneill, NYT Bestselling author of _Unmentionable_ and _Ungovernable_


"Horses, monsters, and a spark of romance -- this is my new favorite kind of fantasy." —Kate Ristau, Author of _Clockbreakers_ and _Shadow Girl_


**Closing the Store**

Liz Stratton is a talk show host who runs for president of the United States on the platform of ending a never-ending war. However, during a debate, she is patronized by another (male) candidate, and she goes off-script, calling for a sex strike to end the war. This is awkward because she just found the love of her life.

Liz didn’t mean to start a sex strike…but she'll use it to end a war and win an election.

Liz A. Stratton is running for President of the United States to end the unpopular war in Mesopotamianstan.

Everything goes as planned until the first debate when Liz’s competitors patronize her. She loses her temper and declares that if every woman in America withheld sex, the war would be over in weeks.

So women all over the country actually “close the store.”

Now the fun starts.

5 stars: Sassy and sometimes raunchy women take charge of a male-driven political scene, with a bit of romance thrown in to keep things interesting.
5 Stars: There so many smiles and bursts of laughter during this book, and two instances where I cried with joy. I loved this book so much!

**Fuzzy Logic**

Meg moves to an alpaca ranch from the city to start a quiet life on her own after her divorce, but is surprised by two handsome men who pursue her, an intrigue at work, and life and death on the farm. Life is hardly quiet, but it’s better.

It’s Bridget Jones’s Diary meets James Herriot.


5 stars: I love the title for Fuzzy Logic by Maren Anderson. It’s concise, cute and intriguing. Sums the entire book up in just two words. Since I’m an animal lover, it seemed a logical decision for me to read this book, and I’m so glad that I did.
From the minute you begin page 1, the reader is drawn into Fuzzy Logic. The characters are well drawn and one gets the feeling they are actually on the Alpaca farm with protagonist, Meg. Poor Meg thinks that after getting away from a cheating husband and moving onto an Alpaca farm in rural Oregon will be a simple, quiet life she desires, but life has a wat of throwing a curve or two in our paths.
Fuzzy Logic is a wonderful, cute story one can read again and again. At just 186 pages, you’ll find the pages turn quite quickly. They did for me. Once I began reading it, I read until I finished it all in one day. Watch out though! You may wind up falling in love with Alpacas as much as Meg and this reader did.


5 stars: "Fuzzy Logic" is a great, quick, sweet read. It's a warm-hearted story that is uplifting. While following Meg on her self-discovery, the reader gets a glimpse into life with alpacas, which is amazing. (Warning: This book may make you fall in love with alpacas, too! Meg's passion for the creatures is contagious!) Anderson captures the conflicts some women go through in relationships, particularly the internal ones that need to be overcome before true love can be found. I recommend this book to all the women in my life. -- Emily M.

**Commas: An Irreverent Primer**

What is a grammar dragon? What happens to unicorns when you misuse FANBOYS?
Commas: An Irreverent Primer will explain. 
This irreverent guide for using our most common punctuation mark is now available online and in great bookstores like Another Read Through.
You should go get it.
If not for yourself, then do it for the unicorns.

What is a grammar dragon? What happens to unicorns when you misuse FANBOYS? This irreverent guide for using our most common punctuation mark will explain. This primer doesn't cover every single use of commas--it's only sixty pages, for heaven's sake! But it does explain the comma errors English professors most often marked wrong on their students’ papers. All that red ink stung. Hence, this book. Oh, and the fairies, dragons, and trolls? Well, why not fairies, dragons, and trolls? Examples should be memorable (or at least mythical). Some comma topics included are: Commas and Independent Clauses Commas after Introductory Phrases Commas and Nonrestrictive Clauses Commas and Quotes Commas and Coordinate Adjectives So, don’t be a comma idiot. Either buy a grammar dragon or read this book. I promise the book won’t eat you. No guarantees on that dragon.

5 Stars: I recently purchased this book, and it was everything I expected and more. The two authors go through the rules of using commas, and they do it with great (correct and incorrect) examples, using sentences they created. The above accounts for about 2/3 of the book. The final 1/3 consists of workbook style exercises, and a glossary.
If you're looking for a clear and concise book on when (and when not) to use commas, this is it. The icing on the cake is the authors' senses of humor; they are funny! I'd recommend it to anyone. ~Jim Mindrum

5 Stars: This is a hilarious, fun book! Highly recommended! I bought it for my brother, who is completing his grad school entrance essays.

5 Stars: Very well done. Despite the fact that I spent most of my elementary years in private schools, I only vaguely recall the whys of grammar. "Commas" was a great refresher course for me...and the exercises in the back reinforced the rules. I would highly recommend this for all levels of writers, fiction or non. And yes, LOVED the humor.
