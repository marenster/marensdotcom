**Pre-order Now! On Sale July 29, 2019**

All Rosie wants is to tear down the ancient cowshed on her ranch to make room for more horses, but it is unlucky to knock down a barn because it could disturb a sprite. Rosie thinks this is superstitious hogwash. That’s why she and her handsome new client, Patrick, get drunk one night and knock the shed down with the tractor, unleashing something very dark and very angry.

Rosie is thrust into a world of magic she didn’t know existed. But the cowsprite is deadly and won’t leave. Now all Rosie wants is for life to go back to normal. Or does she?
