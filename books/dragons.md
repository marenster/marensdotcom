# H1 *[The Dragons of Mary's Peak](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/product/B094XRJQ8M)*

*[The Dragons of Mary's Peak](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/product/B094XRJQ8M)* is a book that is party fantasy, part thriller, part mystery, and part small-town drama. The mystery is that something is killing livestock and dogs in rural Oregon and leaving a trail of poisonous scales in its wake. The Sheriff thinks the culprit is a rogue cougar, but Rosanna and the county veterinarian wonder if the producer of the toxin isn't something more...exotic. It's Jaws meets E.T. meets Contagion, but with dragons!
