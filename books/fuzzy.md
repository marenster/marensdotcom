title:  "Fuzzy Logic"
subtitle: She thinks moving to a ranch will lead to the simple life she craves, but the countryside has other ideas…
---

After her divorce, Meg Taylor buys an alpaca ranch to finally do something on her own. Almost as soon as she arrives, she meets not one, but two handsome (and baffling) men. She thinks choosing between the shy veterinarian and her charming securities co-worker is her biggest problem until life and death on the ranch make her re-evaluate more than her love life. Her new life is nothing like her old one, that’s for sure.

5.0 out of 5 stars--A wonderful, cute story one can read again and again.

I love the title for Fuzzy Logic by Maren Anderson. It’s concise, cute and intriguing. Sums the entire book up in just two words. Since I’m an animal lover, it seemed a logical decision for me to read this book, and I’m so glad that I did.

From the minute you begin page 1, the reader is drawn into Fuzzy Logic. The characters are well drawn and one gets the feeling they are actually on the Alpaca farm with protagonist, Meg. Poor Meg thinks that after getting away from a cheating husband and moving onto an Alpaca farm in rural Oregon will be a simple, quiet life she desires, but life has a wat of throwing a curve or two in our paths.

Fuzzy Logic is a wonderful, cute story one can read again and again. At just 186 pages, you’ll find the pages turn quite quickly. They did for me. Once I began reading it, I read until I finished it all in one day. Watch out though! You may wind up falling in love with Alpacas as much as Meg and this reader did.

5.0 out of 5 stars--"Fuzzy Logic" is a great, quick

"Fuzzy Logic" is a great, quick, sweet read. It's a warm-hearted story that is uplifting. While following Meg on her self-discovery, the reader gets a glimpse into life with alpacas, which is amazing. (Warning: This book may make you fall in love with alpacas, too! Meg's passion for the creatures is contagious!) Anderson captures the conflicts some women go through in relationships, particularly the internal ones that need to be overcome before true love can be found. I recommend this book to all the women in my life.
