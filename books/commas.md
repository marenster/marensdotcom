"Commas: An Irreverent Primer" is awesome.

What is a grammar dragon? What happens to unicorns when you misuse FANBOYS? This irreverent guide for using our most common punctuation mark will explain. This primer doesn't cover every single use of commas--it's only sixty pages, for heaven's sake! But it does explain the comma errors English professors most often marked wrong on their students’ papers. All that red ink stung. Hence, this book. Oh, and the fairies, dragons, and trolls? Well, why not fairies, dragons, and trolls? Examples should be memorable (or at least mythical). Some comma topics included are: Commas and Independent Clauses Commas after Introductory Phrases Commas and Nonrestrictive Clauses Commas and Quotes Commas and Coordinate Adjectives So, don’t be a comma idiot. Either buy a grammar dragon or read this book. I promise the book won’t eat you. No guarantees on that dragon.

5.0 out of 5 stars--fun read!

This is a hilarious, fun book! Highly recommended! I bought it for my brother, who is completing his grad school entrance essays. LOVE that I got a free Kindle copy with it!!! And have to love that it's written by professors at my alma mater, Western Oregon University!

5.0 out of 5 stars--Easy to understand & useful!

Very well done. Despite the fact that I spent most of my elementary years in private schools, I only vaguely recall the whys of grammar. "Commas" was a great refresher course for me...and the exercises in the back reinforced the rules. I would highly recommend this for all levels of writers, fiction or non. And yes, LOVED the humor.
